Revision history for Perl extension Java::Build.

0.04  Mon Sep 15 08:54:30 CDT 2003
        - Corrected small problems with the demo build so it will actually
          run on other people's machines.  (It used to depend on absolute
          paths, I made them relative.)
        - Added Test::More to the PREREQ_PM list in Makefile.PL.
        - Cleaned GenericBuild test file.
        - Improved GenericBuild error when GO receives a target that isn't
          in its list.
        - Corrected GenericBuild so it doesn't die when the BUILD_SUCCESS
          file is initially missing.
        - Corrected GenericBuild so GO no longer does an extra step when
          user requests two targets, the later of which is currently
          in BUILD_SUCCESS.
        - Changed Tasks::read_prop_file so it uses a bare return if it
          can't read the file.  It used to kill the program.  That lead
          to odd log entries when Tasks::update_prop_file was asked to
          update an absent file.
        - Made it a fatal error to supply a BASE_DIR argument to
          Tasks::build_file_list which is not an existing directory.
        - Added optional INCLUDE_PATTERNS parameter to
          Tasks::make_jar_classpath.  Now callers can control which files
          end up in the list.  In particular, they can have both .jar and .zip.

        - Added Java::Build::GenericBuild to be the top level controller of
          builds.
        - Added a demo directory to the distrubution to show how builds might
          be built.
        - Changed Java::Build::JVM so that compile error are fatal.
          All calls to its compile method should be eval'ed to trap errors.
        - Changed jar and jarsigner Tasks so they only log when their
          underlying call returns something.
        - Changed jar and jarsigner so they call croak when their underlying
          command fails.
        - Corrected jar so it doesn't stay in the base directory of the jar
          contents when it dies.  This is important for callers who are
          trapping fatal errors with eval.

        - Modified Java compiling code so that errors from javac are not
          dumped directly onto standard out.  Now when compile returns false,
          the caller should call dump_errors on the compiling object to
          retrieve the errors.
