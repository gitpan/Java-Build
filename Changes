        - Modified Java compiling code so that errors from javac are not
          dumped directly onto standard out.  Now when compile returns false,
          the caller should call dump_errors on the compiling object to
          retrieve the errors.

        - Added Java::Build::GenericBuild to be the top level controller of
          builds.
        - Added a demo directory to the distrubution to show how builds might
          be built.
        - Changed Java::Build::JVM so that compile error are fatal.
          All calls to its compile method should be eval'ed to trap errors.
        - Changed jar and jarsigner Tasks so they only log when their
          underlying call returns something.
        - Changed jar and jarsigner so they call croak when their underlying
          command fails.
        - Corrected jar so it doesn't stay in the base directory of the jar
          contents when it dies.  This is important for callers who are
          trapping fatal errors with eval.
